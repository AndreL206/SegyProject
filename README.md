# SegyProject
Codes to work with SegY file format while keeping it as simple as possible
Work in progress
Current possibilities : open SegY file (from bytes) and rewrite
As this is a recent project, the SegY you want to read have to be quite simple (rev0)
Reading is only available with big endian and IBM bytes encoding. Those have to be entered manually
Files can only be written using big endian and IEEE.
