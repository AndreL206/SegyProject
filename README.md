# SegyProject
Codes to work with SegY file format while keeping it as simple as possible. Work in progress.

Current possibilities : open SegY file (from bytes) and rewrite.

As this is a recent project, the SegY you want to read has to be quite simple (rev0).

Reading is only available with big endian and IBM bytes encoding. Those have to be entered manually.

Files can only be written using big endian and IEEE.

If needed, you can find infos about SegY format [here](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/SEG-Y).
And if you need sample data you can consult [USGS marine data](https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/data/2001_010_FA/).
